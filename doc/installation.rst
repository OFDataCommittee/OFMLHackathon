SmartRedis clients are intended to be used as a library linked into other
applications.  For C, C++, and Fortran, the clients
can be compiled as a library that is linked with an application
at compile time. For Python, the clients can be used just like
any other pip library.

This document will show how to:
  1. Install the SmartRedis Python client from the release
  2. Build and install SmartRedis as a static lib from release
  3. Build SmartRedis from source
