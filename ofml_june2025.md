## TLTR

The OpenFOAM [Data-driven modelling SIG](https://wiki.openfoam.com/Data_Driven_Modelling_Special_Interest_Group) organizes the first in-person OpenFOAM-ML hackathon! The hackathon is scheduled for **June 16-18, 2025**, at TU Dresden's [Institute of Fluid Mechanics](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/maschinenwesen/ism/psm/die-professur) (Dresden, Germany). The number of participants is limited to 15 ([selection process](#application)). The participation fee is **EUR 250**.

## Schedule

Since the event is in-person, all times are in CEST.

The hackathon's core idea is that people with different backgrounds in fluid dynamics, numerics, mathematics, or machine machine learning put their heads together to rapidly build prototypes of OpenFOAM-ML workflows. Each participant brings his/her **own challenge project** to work on. These ideas will be presented and discussed in the **project introduction** session. Thereafter, participants with similar or overlapping interests team up, and we start coding for the next two days. On the final day, the teams put together a small presentation to **document and share the progress**. The basis for the **presentation and feedback** session can be Jupyter notebooks, code snippets, diagrams, or whatever participants worked out during the hacking sessions (no fancy slides needed).

## Application

Before applying, please note the following:

- since the event is in-person, the number of participants is limited to **15**
- the participation fee is **EUR 250** and includes lunch and coffee breaks
- the project idea should not require access to proprietary data or information such that knowledge can be shared among participants
- we build minimal working prototypes, so you only need a laptop; no access to HPC resources is provided or needed
- we encourage participants to prepare easy parts of their ideas before the event (simplified simulation setups, e.g., without proprietary geometries, low computational cost), such that we can tackle the tricky bits during the event

If you would like to apply, please tell us a few sentences about your idea.
