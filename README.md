# OpenFOAM Machine Learning Hackathon

Welcome to the *OpenFOAM machine learning hackathon* repository! The hackathon is a community event organized by the [data-driven modeling special interest group](https://wiki.openfoam.com/Data_Driven_Modelling_Special_Interest_Group). If you are an OpenFOAM user excited about combining OpenFOAM and machine learning, this event is for you!

## How does it work?

A hackathon is an intensive get-together for creative problem solving in groups. The goal is to build minimal working prototypes of OpenFOAM-ML projects in a limited amount of time, typically three full days. The project ideas come from the participants or the organizers. To build the prototypes, we team up in small groups based on interests and prior knowledge. At the end of the workshop, each groups documents, presents, and shares their progress.

The workshop is either virtual or in-person. For virtual events, there is no geographical restriction for participants, but keep in mind that we cannot accommodate all time zones. The organizers' time zone is CET.

## Next hackathon

The [next hackathon](./ofml_june2025.md) will be held in June, 2025, and is an in-person event.
